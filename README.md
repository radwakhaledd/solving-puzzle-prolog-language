implementation of solving puzzle (Cycle Detection and A* Search with Color Constraints) prolog code Cycle Detection and A* Search with Color Constraints This repository contains Prolog code for two main functionalities: cycle detection in a grid-like structure and A* search algorithm with color constraints.

Cycle Detection Description: The cycle detection functionality allows you to find cycles of a specified color in a grid-like structure. This can be useful in various scenarios such as game development or graph theory.

Usage: To use the cycle detection functionality, define a board configuration in Prolog format, where each cell contains a color. Then call the findCycle/1 predicate with the defined board configuration as its argument. This predicate will output any cycles found in the board.

Example: prolog Copy code % Define the board configuration board([ [red, red, yellow, yellow], [red, blue, red, red], [red, red, red, yellow], [blue, red, blue, yellow] ]).

% Find cycles in the board findCycle(Board). A* Search with Color Constraints Description: The A* search with color constraints functionality performs a pathfinding algorithm considering color constraints between cells in a grid-like structure. This is useful in scenarios where movement between cells is restricted by colors.

Usage: To use the A* search with color constraints functionality, define a start state, a goal state, and a board configuration in Prolog format, where each cell contains a color. Then call the findPath/3 predicate with the start state, goal state, and board configuration as its arguments. This predicate will output the optimal path from the start state to the goal state considering color constraints.

Example: prolog Copy code % Define the start state, goal state, and board configuration Start = [0, 0], % Start state coordinates Goal = [3, 3], % Goal state coordinates Board = [ % Board configuration [red, red, yellow, yellow], [red, blue, red, red], [red, red, red, yellow], [blue, red, blue, yellow] ].

% Find the optimal path from the start state to the goal state findPath(Start, Goal, Board). Notes: Ensure that Prolog is properly installed and configured on your system to execute the code. Modify the board configuration, start state, and goal state according to your requirements. The code is written in Prolog and is compatible with most Prolog interpreters.
